This has one great quality in the body! It is known as a suicide inhibitor. This product is proven to bind to Aromatase, which is the nasty enzyme that converts Testosterone into Estrogen. Estrogen conversion through Aromatase is one key factor in destroying your gains and stopping you from being lean and vascular. On cycle, it is a great way to prevent the symptoms of extra estrogen like increased water weight and more. Off cycle it provides a positive Testosterone to Estrogen ratio that can help restore natural Testosterone production. Additionally we added Diadzin, which is a phyto-chemical that acts in two great ways in the body. One, it is a competitive estrogen inhibitor, which prevents binding of real estrogen to your receptors. Two, it is shown in the literature to be a partial binder of 5 alpha reductase (5aR). This is the other nasty enzyme that is responsible for hair loss! Post cycle it may help re-grow lost hair and boost normal testosterone levels. Used on or off cycle to increase androgen levels and reduce estrogen. Building a few pounds of muscle simply requires that you lift heavy and eat a surplus of calories.

(88,	1,	'MHP: A-Bomb 224 tablets',	'<p>A-BOMB is, without question, the most exciting development in the science of muscle growth. It is the first supplement to trigger your genetic muscle building machinery from multiple pathways and synergistic anabolic actions. A-BOMB\'s highly researched ingredients work at the DNA level through non-hormonal signal transduction by manipulating key muscle growth regulators mTOR, PKB, p70s6k, 4E-BP1, FOXO and MAFbx. A-BOMB maximizes this process through two critical pathways. The first pathway is the  &#8224;˜nutrient dependent pathway\', in which A-BOMB uses specific amino acids and nutrients to modulate signaling through pathways traditionally triggered by hormones. The second pathway is the  &#8224;˜insulin dependent pathway\', in which A-BOMB has the unique ability to mediate the release of insulin without raising blood sugar. Simultaneously signaling these pathways allows for maximum gene activation at the DNA level to  &#8224;˜turn on\' the muscle building process. A-BOMB even goes a step further to improve muscle gene activation by upregulating your DNA\'s central control system. Using a clinically proven DNA remodeling compound, A-BOMB removes damaged cells and repairs DNA damage allowing your genetic cellular machinery to respond better to the signaling of these key muscle growth regulators. In addition to its critical role at the genetic level, A-BOMB\'s unique ability to augment a controlled, steady release of insulin creates the ideal insulinotropic anabolic environment, increasing protein synthesis to stimulate muscle growth. A-BOMB also induces muscle hypertrophy through a very powerful anabolic mechanism called Intracellular Osmolarity (IO), which creates an anabolic reaction within the muscle cell. Interestingly, Intracellular Osmolarity works both independently as well as synergistically to mTOR signal transduction. So, not only is Intracellular Osmolarity anabolic in itself, it will further enhance gene expression.\r\n</p>',	'',	0,	'<p>Microcrystalline cellulose, guar gum, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylcellulose, vegetable stearin, anhydrous dicalcium phosphate, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, silica and film coating (polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide). </p>',	'<p>As a dietary supplement, take 4 tablets in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening. </p>',	'',	'',	'MAXHABOM02240000TB.html',	''),

Through the development of Cyclin-GF, MHP\'s research team has discovered the secret of how to activate these dormant but precious Muscle Precursor Cells (MPCs) and promote the anabolic internal environment necessary to stimulate Muscle Precursor Cell (MPC) activation and carry them through the vital full phase muscle growth cycle needed to achieve massive muscle fiber maturity.
